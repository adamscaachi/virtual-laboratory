## Counts

A count readout is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. The average number of counts measured depends on the user's distance from the source and is determined using the inverse square law and a pre-specified constant $k$. The number of counts measured at any given second is generated from a Poisson distribution, prompting the user to consider important aspects of experimental science such as statistical error.

## Graph

The user can input their data into a graph on the wall using the UI input fields, they can also fit an inverse square function with an adjustable $k$ parameter using the UI slider.
